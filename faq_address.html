<h>I just want to search for a general area, how do I do that?</h>
<p>Our minimum requirement is a zip code, therefore you can just search the zip-code of the area. However, for directions, its best you enter a full address</p>
<h>I keep being redirected back here, what's happeing?</h>
<p>Hmmm... the address you're entering must not be recognized by Google Maps. Try putting it in the format street address, city, state, zipcode.</p>
<h>What if I change my mind</h>
<p>You can always come back to this page from the results page!</p>
